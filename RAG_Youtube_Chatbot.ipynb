      "Hi and welcome to today's meeting C++interview with Amar who's written a bookon embedded with C++. Uh let me quicklyshow you the book. This is a book whichwe're going to see in a minute. Um butfirst let's get started with anintroduction to know actually who Amaris.Um yeah uh hi Yens. Hi everyone. Uh Yensthank you for having me. I'm very muchexcited to be here. to be able uh totalk about my book. And I'd like toapologize to everyone for the delay. Uhwe had technical difficultiesuh with this Bluetooth technology. Butyeah, I hope I'm coming over well andyou can hear me well. And yeah, I'm anembedded engineer for uh almost 10 yearsnow. And uh around seven years ago Istarted a small company in Bostonhergoina called assembly and we do a lotof interesting uh embedded projects. UmI started my career as uh almost anyembedded developer uh using C languagefor programming these tiny devices. Uhbut soon enough I figured out that C++can be useful for uh what I'm doing andI started applying it and using it in myprojects. Um and yeah that's uh shortlyabout me.That's nice. And so today we are here totalk aboutthis book uh C++ and embedded systemswhich um Amar wrote and it's a practicaltransition from C to modern C++ andthat's very much true. So let's have alook into this bookbygoing to the table of contents and justlooking at the various chapters. Thereis various parts, four parts in total.And I think um the book is useful forembedded developers, but generally ifyou'rea a C++ developer, the book is alsostill holding up. Um and as you know thesubtitle shows there there's also uhsome C code in here. Um so we have thefirst chapter starting with debunkingsome common myths about C++. And if wego into this chapter um we can see therejust an introduction into C++ and modernC++. And here we see like a firstexample that um you can have an array asan SD array um which I think is a niceexample how to use modern C++to replace basic C types umand then we go on using algorithms etc.Sowhat'sthen you know there's more and more andmore um let's go to chapter two uhchallenges in embedded systems withlimited resources. So we directly divenow into embedded systems and that ismore domain. So what is uh kind of yourthoughts on the second chapter?Um yeah so uhhere we discuss uh mainly uh challengesin safety critical and uh real-timesystems with hard requirements and twothings that I often criticized u interms of C++ is that uh you can't usestandard library without dynamic memoryallocation uh which is not true rightyou you need to be aware of uhcontainers that are using it and thosethat are not. Uh but studio array is angreat example and it brings just a lotuh in your daily life working uh with uhcontainers. Uh so uh here we discussedthat uh first uh you can use alsostandard library and those parts that uhdo not uh use dynamic allocationinternally. Uh the other part isdiscussing exceptions uh as they areoften criticized as beingnondeterministicuh meaning you can't predict that um youknow how much time uh would somethingtake uh which is really important insystems with hard realtime requirementsbut exceptions can be disabled right souh you can't disable them and you stillcan use u C++ in your projects also RTIuh can be disabled of course and uhthose are some of concerns of uhembedded developers. So uh you want tohave deterministic predictable systemsand uh here we focus on discussing uhhow to mitigate those um concerns.Right.Right. Here we go about uh disablingunwanted C++ features. And then we talkabout the C++ ecosystem for embeddedum andwhat what is what does the book tell youabout this? Um uh here we go through uhavailable tool chains uh from uhdifferent vendors and uh there there'sspecial accent on uh you know if if youare working with safety critical systemsthen you need to use certified toolsright and uh most of the tools are quitelagging in adopting the lateststandards. So at the time of writing thebook uh majority of tools that offercertified compilers uh provide you withC++ 17 right and the book was written uhmostly last year. So um that's uh anissue for people that are working on uhcritical on on critical systems and yeahthey are basically bound to using uh nowthe C++ 17 um if they want to complywith the regulations. All right. uhstill uh if you're not working onsomething that's safety critical you canuse uh GCC supports the latest standardsand hand as well so you can use thoseright uh beside this uh we also brieflydiscussed this other useful things suchas static analyzersum ufor unit testing and a bit profilingprofiling is interesting in the contextof the embedded development as uh youcan't really use the tools that you canon your desk machines right because youneed to interact with embedded targetstill there's plenty of options uh forthere that as well and uh I'm suggestingjust a few uh that might be useful forpeople it's not really specific to C++it's just you know in general whetheryou're writing code in C or C++ orwhatsoever uh profile filing is uhimportant and uh we just briefly discussthe process uh thereindeed. Um then we follow up withsetting up the development environmentfor an embedded C++ project. Umwhat's kind of the environment you usefor the book? Um so uh there we set upuh environment uh using VS code as theeditor u or the ID right uh we are usingcmake uh for build system and we areusing uh GCC compiler um on top of thatuh we are using renode simulator to runthe firmware uh in the simulation soanyone who is reading book uh will getuh access to the Docker container thatuh has all of these tools contained andall you really need to do is uh set upthe Docker, run the container, and youhave access to uh the tool chain and uheverything you need to uh run theexamples uh in in a simulator. Um youcan still uh run the programs on thetarget if you will but for that youwould need a development board and youneed to flash the uh binary to to atarget right.Yeah.So we spoke a bit before uh theinterview about that the book isbasically set up that you can runeverything without having the neededhardware. Yeah,but if you have the hardware and if youhave the experience already then you cantry out then the code test and you alsotest it on on definitely on on embeddedplatforms.And now again chapter five we go back toC++ now and discuss the building blockof C++ applications with classes. Umuhso uh this chapter chapter five andchapter six I believe are used as uheither starting point from someone who'scoming from Cdoesn't really have a lot of knowledgeand experience about C++ or even forpeople uh who do have some knowledgeabout C++ I think uh some of these partsmay be useful. Uh so we discuss uh inthis one mainly classes uhinitialization and uh you know simsimilar similar things. Yeah, I see herein chapter six, you're now going intoname spaces, function overloading,interoperability with C references, andstandard library containers andalgorithms, which makes a lot of senseto give people an introduction to thoseparts of the language if they're comingfrom C or if it's they need a refresheron that, which you know, that's ouraudience. Umthen we are again diving back into thefirmware and embedded space with aseventh chapter on strengtheningfirmware practical C++ error handlingmethods.Um and here we mainly talk about errorhandling. Um here now actually also is apart with exceptions which I rememberfrom the book. Umsoum yeahuh so uh we discuss here uh the commonuh methodologies of handling thefirmware in uh C code and that's throughthe error codes right so uh C is mainlylimited to that uh you can also usethings such as global error handlers andsuch uh and after discussing those andshowing people how they can use these uhin C++. We also cover exceptions here.Uh to some extent uh also uh we showthem how they can uh override theterminator default terminator and usethat if they will. Um and we also coveruh things such as stood optional whichis not really used for error handling uhkind of is you know if you have let'ssay a function or method uh that uhreturns some data from a sensor uh itcan return data but uh it can alsoreturn nothing as data is not ready forsome reason. So stood optional uh isuseful in those scenarios in the contextof the embedded uh development and ofcourse we cover stood uh expected as oneof the methodologies for um handlingerrors.Yeah. And that's also basically what thestandard now has to offer in thisregard. Um then we move on to the eighthchapter when we actually also now getinto templates and concepts. So we havea bit more advanced C++ features here inthe book covered now.Yeah. Uh so uh we cover basics of uhtemplates and meta programming there. uhstarting with uh the example of uh sisimple simple calculations uh and howyou can do them in at compile time andalso showing the equivalent with uhconstexer and we also cover here spin abasics of uh template meta programmingand uh we also touch a bit CRTP as uhcompile time uh polymorphismum pattern, right? Uh so uh the thesethings are briefly covered. Uh you knowuh templates and everything related totemplates is just a huge field andpeople are writing books just on thesetopics. Uh but the intention of this uhchapter is to uh give readerintroduction to template templates. Thisis by uh you know no any means a fullguide or whatsoever for templates but Ithink it serves well for introducingpeople to templates and applications ofof templates in in the code. Yeah, I Ithink that um if if you write a bookabout like apply applying C++ into afield like embedded, you you can't havelike also include the full language likeeverything about templates as a book onits own. Um andthen we get into you know using some ofthose features to build strong types anduse type safety.Uh which I think is again um one of thethings which uh where C++ shines incontrast to C and embedded when youactually can have you know some of thecalculations which otherwise would be atruntimecomp time and checks.Mhm. Uh yeah so uh we we cover uhimplicit conversions in C++ and alsoexplicit one uh in this chapter and uhthen then we move to strong types and uI used uh as an example a function froma C library uh provided by vendor uhit's part of BL stack on one of theplatforms that I worked on And uhbasically we show how we can use strongtypes to uh let's say fix some of theflows of of this function. It's uhfunction with bunch of parameters andyeah that's that's one and most of themare un 16 and most of those parametersare some kind of uh time intervals uhbut they are all treated differently. uhso they are using couple of differentmacros for uh those arguments and it'squite easy to you know swap those macrosand to use wrong one and here we showhow we can wrap this simple C functionin a u C++ to use strong types so uh ifyou actually uh swap uh those uhpreviously macros now typesuh the compiler wouldn't the compile thecompile would fail and compiler wouldalert you that uh you are using actuallywrong type uh yeah soyeah okayumthen we are in chapter 10 where the bookis then going into expressing you knowwriting expressive code with lambdas umyeah I think lambdas in general are agreat uh use case and generally makingthe it's a great feature.Yeah. Yeah. I I mean if you if you justtake uh you know take as an example anyC function uh that expects uh a somekind of call back or or similar and youare scrolling through code and you seeuh that function accepts uh somecallback and you're interested in thatfunctionality then you need either tochange file or scroll somewhere and seewhat's going on. uh right but Clambdaallows you to capture that functionalityuh in a place that's close to the callsite. So that's uh one one of theapplications which just adds to uhreadability and to expressiveness of ofthe code rightthat is true and yeah I like that you'realso then showing people that stdfunction can be used with lambdas and umthen you're using a tier 4 GPIO portsandum so the book has not always but insome chapters I've seen these nice UMLgraphswhich um I I really like makes it kindof more graphical to to people what ishappening andyesum here's another example umyeah so so that that's uh a basically alet's call it GPI interrupt manager souh on a microcontroller we have a bunchof pins and some of them you may beusing let's say as buttons so uh what wedo in that example is show you how totie interrupt that are coming from thatthose those buttons to functionalitythat you provide uh to those objectsthrough lambdas and yeah I I think it'suh something let's say different to whatfolks in uh C world are uh seeing uh andyeah use that as an example to to showhow you can use lambdasyeah I I think it's a very usefulfeature also showing like you know howto apply it to an embedded uh problemdomain. Um and and then we return to thewhole compiled time domain and use itforcomputation.Yeah. Uh well the the con expert is justone of my favorite uh features andcompile time computations in in general.Right.So uh hereuh we show uh we we gently guide readeruh to an example which shows them howthey can build a utility which allowsthem to calculate really complex signalsat compile time. And in in uh if if youscroll down there is this huge formulauh that we are using as a um table foruh temperature sensor uh which allowsyou to get uh yeah it's that one. Umif you scrollwhen I scroll up that you had uh here asthe first example a MAC address par.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think addresses aregenerally paring addresses and stringsat at time.So that that that right that allows youto enter the MAC address in humanreadable string. Yeah. And as you saiduh it allows you to parse it to uh anarray uh and it allows you to catch anan error there, right? Uh so those aretwo two functionalitiesuh that uh this piece of code is givingus. One to capture those kind of errorsand the second one is uh it convertsthis string which is human readable tojust six bytes in an array at compiletime. So nothing nothing is executed inruntime and everything happens atruntime at compile time. Right. Yeah.And and then the second example is thethe lookup table which you mentioned andthis is the example here. Umywe build a a strct signal andyeah that looks interesting.Umand here we are in the generating codethen at compile time. that is I thinkthat that's why I think it's like youknow it applies to the embedded domainbut also like if you're just generallydoing C++ and you're naturally probablyinterested and also having some embeddedknowledge the book works really well inthat domain um then we have a chapterabout writing C++ h so the hardwareproduction layer whichagain we're back into embedded rightyeahuh so uh Here we see how yeah uh most ofthe peripher not most all of theperipherals on modern microcontrollersare basically memory mapped meaning thatuh if you want to set up a GPIO uh youyou just uh write uh something in apiece of memory which in returns sets upand configures a register which ishandling that peripheral. Uh so there wesee how we do it in C and afterwards weuh go through a bit of uh template magicto see how we can strengthen that in C++uh and you know to have all thosecompile time checks. So uh they areregisters with some bit fields and whatwe want to do is to uh know exactly atcompile time which bit field are wesetting up uh which value are we writingto it and uh in in C you can uh writebasically anything at that memoryaddress nothing's going to stop you butuh with utility as this one uh we arestrengthening that and we are gettingthose compile time checks uh which arewhich allows us to write uh in in a bitfield only uh valid values right and uhall of that uh for uh you know we don'tpay any price in terms of additionalbinary size or additional computationsat runtime as everything is being doneat compile time.Yeah. And then you go into timers. Um,which is again something which you canset up at at compile time and then haveyou knowbe checked for being correct and addingup to things that make sense.Right.Andthat brings us to chapter 13 which isworking with C libraries which of courseyou know that's also every every day weinterface with C and C++. Sothisum uh yeah so so uh we show there how wecan uh wrap a a let's say C hell uh inC++uh in order to make a piece of code uhplatform independent or hardwareindependent. So for an example we canhave a uh you know uh some kind of uhwe can have let's say uh uhaccelerometer class which uh is specificto a certain uh accelerometerum and uh in order to communicate withthat accelerometer we need to use let'ssay I squared C interface uh so what wecan do for that accelerometer we canwrite a class that u depends on a IERCinterface which is u a wrapper for uhactual implementation for specifichardware platform and it basically showsyou that right uh how to decouple uhthings and how how to use C++ uh forthat but the same can be done of coursein C and this is just just more about uhthe actual approach in in thedevelopment um itselfandand also yeah of course we are usinggray there uh with an example of a filesystem. So uh LFS is a small file systemfor microcontrollers and there we showhow we can use ray um to you know if weopen a file uh we actually access tofile system and open it and in thisstructure we are closing the file. So uhres resource acquisition isinitialization. So uh we apply thatprinciple on an example of a filesystem.Yeah. And I mean that's just a classicpattern how you uh you know make makethe code betterum also in you know everyone on the teamwill then have a better time um toaccess that library. Umthen we're going to enhance super loopsequencer.Mhm.That's now something where I'm kind ofhave some question marks on my face.What is this uh just about?Yeah. So, uh a super loop is uh let'ssay the most basic uh bare metalarchitecture there is. So, uh yeah,that's a great example. You have mainwith loop and you have bunch of flagsthere and those flags are set from theinterrupts, right? And all that uh mainfunction is doing is going through thoseflags see if they are set. If they areset it will do something uh reset theflag and do that infinitely. And that'sthe most basic thing uh you can do. Uhthen we introduce a sequencer whichbasically allows you to store uh thoselet's call them task. They are basicallyfunctions but let's uh call them task.uh you can store a task in a sequencerand uh sequenceruhyou can define different priorities fortasks right something that's impossiblewith those initial approach uh withflags uhyou can also introduce priorities therebut uh all it's going to happen isyou're going to end up uh in spaghetticode right so basically sequencers issolving those uh problems for you. Itallows you to add add tasks to it and inreturns it executes those tasks for you.So uh we go there through u how toactually store a task and task can begiven as a lambda. uh one of one of theoptions is to use stood functional anduh we also have their alternative uhthere's a utility from um ETL libraryembedded template library and they haveuh equivalents to stood function whichare not using dynamic memory allocationuh which is something that's importantfor lot of embedded people so I use thatopportunity to introduce it and to showit how how it can be used right. Uh theother thing we we do there isintroducing uh stood priority Q and weprovide it with I believe uh stood uhnot stood vector but ETL vector and uhETL vector is vector from em embeddedtemplate library. It has the sameinterface as stood vector. The onlydifference is that uh once youinitialize it you give it size. It hasfixed size. So you can think about it asa fixed size vector which is alsoimportant for embedded people as they'regoing to be certain that there's nodynamic memory allocation and suchright.Yeah.Yeah. That's interesting. And especiallylike there's a domain specific libraryum which also kind of you know has typeswhich are similar to the modern C++focusand that that allow you that allows youto use them in uh stood algorithms forexample or even in this example you canuse stood priority Q and provide it withthis ETL vector uh or whatsoever. So uhit shows you how you can still use thisto library with uh let's call thisembedded template library. Uh so the ETLis kind of complementaryary to thestandard library. I I'd say that way.Mhm.Um and then we talk about patterns inthe 15th chapter.Umbuilding a temperature publisher whichis also like something which you know islikea very big problem which uh project Iwanted to say um which a lot of peopledo.Mhm. Um yeah we go there to an exampleof publisher or observer pattern and uhwe we we uh go through the both runtimeand compile time implementation of thepattern. uh the there is an example ofhow to use uh parameter pack to provideit with all those subscribers and inturn you have uh something that hasminimum uh memory footprint and it it'sjust wire let's say wire really nicelythose things for you. Um so uh yeah uhthis is something that's uh often usedin the embedded systems. You you knowyou can uh grab data from a sensor andyou need that data in different places.You want to show it on display. You wantto send it to server. You want to logthat data. Uh and what you can do isjust subscribe to publisher who'soffering that data and then do uh withthat data whatever you want. Right.Mhm. And then we move on in chapter 16to uh finite state machines.Andyeah uhuh please go ahead. Sorry forI I generally think that uh statemachines definitely have their place inin such a book. So I really like thatyou know chapter 16uh goes into um state machines andembedded. Um here we have another youknow diagram.Yeah they are really used often indifferent places for uh from controllingan elevator to uh controlling the stateof B uh controller uh and uh here we'reusing the example of B controller uhwhich can be in couple of differentstates. It can be advertising, it can beconnected, it can be in idle state. uhbut the example is really simplified andit it guides you just through a coupleof different implementation of uh an FSMusing state pattern and at the end weare introducing boost SML uh which isreally great uh library uh which allowsyou to uh define your uh state machinein really expressive way and yet againit has minimum footprint uh as It isdoing a lot of uh event dispatching atcompile time. U so it has greatperformance and minimum memory footprintand it allows you to write reallycomplex um state machines.Interesting. Umthen the 17th chapter you talk aboutlibraries and frameworks. Um and here wenow have the standard library. Again wealready talked a bit about the embeddedtemplate library. And then there is pigboot.Yeah. Uh yeah uh standard library andthe embedded library are being were useda lot in previous chapters and this thisis just a like an overview and here weintroduce uh two interesting projects.One is Google's pigweed uh which is uhkind of an entire framework for theembedded development and it uh does alot of heavy lifting for you. Uh so it'squite an interesting thing that uhpeople can go through this simple basicexample and see uh what it offers and uhhere uh we are using RPC a remoteprocedure call uh feature that it offersand it shows you how you can uh triggercertain actions on your target uh from auh Python console and uh this is quiteuseful uh for two things in the contextof the embedded system. Uh one is uhwhile you're doing development, youoccasionally want to test some uhfunctionality on target and uh you knowif you are working with really complexembedded systems uh you want to be ableto trigger that behavior immediatelywithout waiting to go through certainscenarios or whatsoever. So uh the RPCallows you that. So you can uh triggercertain function call or functionalityon your target uh from a console andthat's something that's also usefulduring manufacturing. So if you'remanufacturing a device, you want to beable to test it uh and there are entirescenarios for testing uh devices duringthe manufacturing process and you need away to trigger certain behaviors. Sothis is something that's uh quiteinteresting in that regard. And theother uh yeahI think like just then like the nextchapter already moves into this like umlike cross platform development and whenyou manufacture things that you know youneed to be able to um not only like testyour code on the embedded platform butalso have the ability to test therebecause some bugs will only show there.Umof course. Yeah. Uhright. As as you said uh the the entirebook is stressing out the importance ofuh hardware independent code uh whichallows you to test that code to test thebusiness logic uh to have the unit testsand uh the this chapter just wraps up uhthat uh story about the softwaredevelopment in in general right with theuh accent on C++ and the embeddedsystemsYeah. And yeah, I think that's that'skind ofthe book closes out on testability andhere the summary. Um,okay. So,let's get started with the interview.And that has been the book overview. Um,it's with 17 chapters. is reallycovering a lot of ground about C++ butalso aboutum embeddedandthen let's see um to the audience justif you have questions then[Music]post them to the chat and I of coursehave some questions preparedSogenerally you know we are in theembedded space. So maybe let's startwith that. Um what embedded hardwarehave you used to test the code and runthe code on uh for thebook? Uh so the the uh code is using theuh STM32F71uh target. uh but uh you don't needactual developer uh development kit inorder to be able to run the code as uhyou can download docker container whichhas the entire tool chain uh preparedfor you and it also has a renodesimulator which allows you to runcompiled code uh in the simulator rightso uh you you can also if if you wantyou can uh run the code you flush youruh target with the firmware. But ingeneral uh if uh you are reading thebook you you don't need uh thedevelopment kit development board at allandumsoI think it's fairly clear for which thisaudience the book is. Umbut like let's take for a minute withC++. Uh what standards have you used ormostly used in the book?Um the the book covers uh features uhfrom standards up up to C++ 23.23. Um but a lot of developers are stillon 17 and now we're moving on to newfeatures. So the book has that covered.Umthat was also my impression. Umlet's uh go into some of the audiencequestions.SoBlizzio asks why don't you use SDLcontainers with specialized allocators?Yeah, that's that's also an option,right? Uh I haven't tried to write aspecialized allocator. Uh to be honest,I think that's quite challenging to getit right uh to guarantee uh theexecution time which is something that'salso important in regards of the realtime embedded systems. Uh you want to besure that the allocation would alwaystake certain amount of time, right?uh still uh yeah that's that's apossibility but uh ETL embedded templatelibrary uh is an alternativeuh for for the containers.Yeah and I I think one thing one alwayshas to see is that the the space in abook is limited. So going into suchcorners as how to specialize uhallocators for embedded um might be thena bit too much. Um which actually bringsmeto question like you know we see a lotof chapters in the book but like whattopics didn't make it?Oh yeah. UhI'd say a lot. Uhso uh things such as bitset is not inthe book. Uh some of the examples Iinitially had in mind that uh could havebeen more visually appealing to peopleare not there. So uh one of the ideas Ihad is seven segment uh display and ituh didn't end in the book. And yeah,there's there's quite a few things thatthat are not there. So, uh by no anymeans this is this is not a completeguide uh for the C++ and embeddedsystems. It is uh let's call it missinguh a lot of things. I wish they werethere, but uh I I was limited by timeand if you'd put everything in a book,it would be uh really really really bigbook, right?Indeed. Uh do you have plans like for afollow-up book?Uh I'm not sure. Let's see uh how thisgoes. Uh let's see uh how the receptionfrom the people is. Uh the book waspublished on 2nd of July. So that waslike 15 days ago. So in uh followingmonths I expect to receive uh morefeedback uh from people who read thebook and I guess that everything willdepend on that if the book is acceptedwell then yeah why not?Mhm. Yeah that's maybe something we weshould mention that the book is is kindof new andsoio has a second question. How can yoube sure that an SD function doesn'tallocate memory while storing lambdas?Uh, one of the things to do is tooverride new and delete operators andjust to monitor them and see if uhthey're being called by anything. Andthat's just uh one of the ways to uhmake sure that uh no one is trying to doany memory allocation. But if you wantto be 100% certain then uh just avoid itright.Yeah I think that especially like youbring up the ETL in this context thatyou know they offer the type whichdoesn't allocate and on the other handum I think with lambdas you're on thesafe side when you're using function umbut I I've had also you know somepitfalls with function and them etc. Um,sothere's another question. Do you plan tocreate an online course with the topicsfrom the book?Uh, no not not really. I don't I don'thave any plans to be honest uh at themoment.Okay. Umthenhow does this book help you to writebetter C++ code?Huh well uh the intention of the book isto introduce C++ to people who aremainly using C in uh their daily workand uh I did uh the best of my abilityto write a good and uh well structuredC++ code. Uh maybe I failed at someparts and if you have any you know uhcriticism on on some portions of it,please let me know.UmI think that the the book probablyreflects your own style and what you doon your on your company, how you um doyour there. So uh what did you learnabout C++ while writing the book?Um uh this is a tough one. Um I I had toexplore some some uh portions of uhof of what I was already applying and uhI was taking some uh things for grantedthat uh I discovered later on that areperhaps a bit different. And uh one ofthem is mostly related to um the uh thestandard library. So uh the one that'sbeing used is um based on uh nanostardlibrary and uh there are just a fewdifferent ways to compile that library uwith or without exceptions and in turnyou end up with uh quite a bigdifference in terms of the memoryconsumptions and it turns out that theexceptions exceptions in this uhimplementationare quite expensive. Uh I haven't uhspent more time uh digging out uh youknow about exceptions and seeing ifthere's any better implementation. Sothat's one of the things that I'm quiteinterested in and uh yeah once I havesome more time that's something that I'dlike to explore further. uh so uh by thetime of writing book I wasn't evenconsidering using exceptions and in oneof the chapters I wrote about them andonly then I saw how uh big portion of uhof the flesh they actually take uhperhaps it's implementation specificperhaps the library itself can becompiled a bit differently to still haveexceptions andto reduce that size. So, uh that'sthat's one of the things that surprisedme a bit.Yeah. So, I think that with embeddedaudience exceptions are not too popular.Oh yeah, that's quitethe question in in the recent yearsalways has become like what what kind ofembedded are you working on and systemshave grown and there's definitely somespace for where exceptions could makesense. Umoutside of that you probably have thiscode then shared ac across your platformand then maybe that's not making senseanymore. Umbut so one one topic which I saw whichhas been very important in the lastdecade in C++ generally is like theexploration of multi-threaded code and Iwonder just you know how is that beingseen in the embedded worldum uh so uh the most of the projectsthat I worked on are still utilizingfree arts uh which has the threads fortasks as they called and in certainapplications it's actually used quite alot uh I haven't I didn't have a chanceto use uh C++ in uh those kinds ofenvironment uh in in last year or so uhI've been mostly working with C on onprojects for our clients uh but yeah uhmulti-threaded code is used quite a lotespecially on a big and and complex umsystems.Okay. Um so just to the audience if youhave any more questions um now it's kindof the time to add them to the chat. Umthere isprobably like when when we talk aboutembedded and the the book covers a bitof safety. Umwe should talk about rust you know is doyou see rust in the embedded space isthat something which is coming up.Uh I I see a lot of people talking aboutit and I see a certain companies arestarted adopting it. Uhso yeah I I I'm seeing uh Rust gettingits way into the uh into the embedded uhlast year and a half or so I was prettymuch occupied with writing uh the bookso I didn't really had chance to exploreRust more but uh I I got the basicpremises of it uh the borrow checker anduh what it offers in terms of uh typeand memory safety uh and uh those thingsare always welcomed in in the embeddedsystems especially those that are safetycritical uh so uh yeah I definitely seeRust having its place in the embeddedall right and there's also a questionand commentin which I see on LinkedIn but itdoesn't show up here in the local studioso let me quickly copy that into abannerand then I can show it here. So whilewhile we at the topic of rust um sothese days are you know they areexploring ways of using rust lang in ourcode for C++ um what are your thoughtsabout mixing rust lang with C++ fordedicated modules and written a must inrust for exampleum uh to be honest I don't have ahands-on experience uh on on rust or onmixing these two but if rust is solvinga problem for you and you want to usethat as a module in C++ or vice versa. Idon't see any any reasons against that.Uh both trust and C++ are tools in inour world. So uh using the right toolfor the right problem is uh mostcertainly welcomed. Right? So if you seethat a good fit then go for it.Yeah, I think uh the interoperability ofRust and C++ is something which somepeople explore currently and for exampleCSV++ we have one talk about that I knowthat KB is exploring it in the contextof doing Rust with cute and so umthere's definitely areas where you findinformation about that um but then againit's like when when when when you doembed with C++ and your everyday work islike C and and C++ then um it's hard tofind like actually you know someone toto pay for your time to go into Rust andto figure out what the best way is toconnect that um so I hope that we thatwe get a better way of you know havingthe standardized and umbecome part of our world umAndthat brings us pretty much to the end.Uh I think um I have no more questions.It's a very interesting book. Thank youfor taking your time and taking the timeto write this book and sharing your ownknowledge with us. Uh which is veryinteresting in in this book definitely.And umI see that at least one person hasbought the book already. Sothank you Floren andthank you very muchwith that Amar final words.Umyeah I I might be biased as I you knowlove C++.Uh I I really that that's something thatI really enjoy. So this is me beingcompletely biased, right? Uh and yeah, Ijust think it's great for the embeddedsystems and if you would like toactually see what it can do for you, uhthen read read the book, right? Uh butthis is a completely biased opinion ofmine.Yeah, I mean it's I think we're on thesame page there. I'm I'm also a bitbiased towards C++ and I think theaudience we reach is too.Umbut generally interesting topic todayand lots of interest. Saw a lot ofpeople in the in the chat and also inthe stream on LinkedIn. Um and if youmade it so far a recording will be outon Saturday. Um anyways, thank you foryour time and I'm going toThank you. Yes. Thank you so much.You're welcome. Also, last but notleast, thank you to Peek for providingthe book and, you know, making thispossible.\n"

       "\"Hi and welcome to today's meeting C++interview with Amar who's written a bookon embedded with C++. Uh let me quicklyshow you the book. This is a book whichwe're going to see in a minute. Um butfirst let's get started with anintroduction to know actually who Amaris.Um yeah uh hi Yens. Hi everyone. Uh Yensthank you for having me. I'm very muchexcited to be here. to be able uh totalk about my book. And I'd like toapologize to everyone for the delay. Uhwe had technical difficultiesuh with this Bluetooth technology. Butyeah, I hope I'm coming over well andyou can hear me well. And yeah, I'm anembedded engineer for uh almost 10 yearsnow. And uh around seven years ago Istarted a small company in Bostonhergoina called assembly and we do a lotof interesting uh embedded projects. UmI started my career as uh almost anyembedded developer uh using C languagefor programming these tiny devices. Uhbut soon enough I figured out that C++can be useful for uh what I'm doing andI started applying it and using it in myprojects. Um and yeah that's uh shortlyabout me.That's nice. And so today we are here totalk aboutthis book uh C++ and embedded systemswhich um Amar wrote and it's a practicaltransition from C to modern C++ andthat's very much true. So let's have alook into this bookbygoing to the table of contents and justlooking at the various chapters. Thereis various parts, four parts in total.And I think um the book is useful forembedded developers, but generally ifyou'rea a C++ developer, the book is alsostill holding up. Um and as you know thesubtitle shows there there's also uhsome C code in here. Um so we have thefirst chapter starting with debunkingsome common myths about C++. And if wego into this chapter um we can see therejust an introduction into C++ and modernC++. And here we see like a firstexample that um you can have an array asan SD array um which I think is a niceexample how to use modern C++to replace basic C types umand then we go on using algorithms etc.Sowhat'sthen you know there's more and more andmore um let's go to chapter two uhchallenges in embedded systems withlimited resources. So we directly divenow into embedded systems and that ismore domain. So what is uh kind of yourthoughts on the second chapter?Um yeah so uhhere we discuss uh mainly uh challengesin safety critical and uh real-timesystems with hard requirements and twothings that I often criticized u interms of C++ is that uh you can't usestandard library without dynamic memoryallocation uh which is not true rightyou you need to be aware of uhcontainers that are using it and thosethat are not. Uh but studio array is angreat example and it brings just a lotuh in your daily life working uh with uhcontainers. Uh so uh here we discussedthat uh first uh you can use alsostandard library and those parts that uhdo not uh use dynamic allocationinternally. Uh the other part isdiscussing exceptions uh as they areoften criticized as beingnondeterministicuh meaning you can't predict that um youknow how much time uh would somethingtake uh which is really important insystems with hard realtime requirementsbut exceptions can be disabled right souh you can't disable them and you stillcan use u C++ in your projects also RTIuh can be disabled of course and uhthose are some of concerns of uhembedded developers. So uh you want tohave deterministic predictable systemsand uh here we focus on discussing uhhow to mitigate those um concerns.Right.Right. Here we go about uh disablingunwanted C++ features. And then we talkabout the C++ ecosystem for embeddedum andwhat what is what does the book tell youabout this? Um uh here we go through uhavailable tool chains uh from uhdifferent vendors and uh there there'sspecial accent on uh you know if if youare working with safety critical systemsthen you need to use certified toolsright and uh most of the tools are quitelagging in adopting the lateststandards. So at the time of writing thebook uh majority of tools that offercertified compilers uh provide you withC++ 17 right and the book was written uhmostly last year. So um that's uh anissue for people that are working on uhcritical on on critical systems and yeahthey are basically bound to using uh nowthe C++ 17 um if they want to complywith the regulations. All right. uhstill uh if you're not working onsomething that's safety critical you canuse uh GCC supports the latest standardsand hand as well so you can use thoseright uh beside this uh we also brieflydiscussed this other useful things suchas static analyzersum ufor unit testing and a bit profilingprofiling is interesting in the contextof the embedded development as uh youcan't really use the tools that you canon your desk machines right because youneed to interact with embedded targetstill there's plenty of options uh forthere that as well and uh I'm suggestingjust a few uh that might be useful forpeople it's not really specific to C++it's just you know in general whetheryou're writing code in C or C++ orwhatsoever uh profile filing is uhimportant and uh we just briefly discussthe process uh thereindeed. Um then we follow up withsetting up the development environmentfor an embedded C++ project. Umwhat's kind of the environment you usefor the book? Um so uh there we set upuh environment uh using VS code as theeditor u or the ID right uh we are usingcmake uh for build system and we areusing uh GCC compiler um on top of thatuh we are using renode simulator to runthe firmware uh in the simulation soanyone who is reading book uh will getuh access to the Docker container thatuh has all of these tools contained andall you really need to do is uh set upthe Docker, run the container, and youhave access to uh the tool chain and uheverything you need to uh run theexamples uh in in a simulator. Um youcan still uh run the programs on thetarget if you will but for that youwould need a development board and youneed to flash the uh binary to to atarget right.Yeah.So we spoke a bit before uh theinterview about that the book isbasically set up that you can runeverything without having the neededhardware. Yeah,but if you have the hardware and if youhave the experience already then you cantry out then the code test and you alsotest it on on definitely on on embeddedplatforms.And now again chapter five we go back toC++ now and discuss the building blockof C++ applications with classes. Umuhso uh this chapter chapter five andchapter six I believe are used as uheither starting point from someone who'scoming from Cdoesn't really have a lot of knowledgeand experience about C++ or even forpeople uh who do have some knowledgeabout C++ I think uh some of these partsmay be useful. Uh so we discuss uh inthis one mainly classes uhinitialization and uh you know simsimilar similar things. Yeah, I see herein chapter six, you're now going intoname spaces, function overloading,interoperability with C references, andstandard library containers andalgorithms, which makes a lot of senseto give people an introduction to thoseparts of the language if they're comingfrom C or if it's they need a refresheron that, which you know, that's ouraudience. Umthen we are again diving back into thefirmware and embedded space with aseventh chapter on strengtheningfirmware practical C++ error handlingmethods.Um and here we mainly talk about errorhandling. Um here now actually also is apart with exceptions which I rememberfrom the book. Umsoum yeahuh so uh we discuss here uh the commonuh methodologies of handling thefirmware in uh C code and that's throughthe error codes right so uh C is mainlylimited to that uh you can also usethings such as global error handlers andsuch uh and after discussing those andshowing people how they can use these uhin C++. We also cover exceptions here.Uh to some extent uh also uh we showthem how they can uh override theterminator default terminator and usethat if they will. Um and we also coveruh things such as stood optional whichis not really used for error handling uhkind of is you know if you have let'ssay a function or method uh that uhreturns some data from a sensor uh itcan return data but uh it can alsoreturn nothing as data is not ready forsome reason. So stood optional uh isuseful in those scenarios in the contextof the embedded uh development and ofcourse we cover stood uh expected as oneof the methodologies for um handlingerrors.Yeah. And that's also basically what thestandard now has to offer in thisregard. Um then we move on to the eighthchapter when we actually also now getinto templates and concepts. So we havea bit more advanced C++ features here inthe book covered now.Yeah. Uh so uh we cover basics of uhtemplates and meta programming there. uhstarting with uh the example of uh sisimple simple calculations uh and howyou can do them in at compile time andalso showing the equivalent with uhconstexer and we also cover here spin abasics of uh template meta programmingand uh we also touch a bit CRTP as uhcompile time uh polymorphismum pattern, right? Uh so uh the thesethings are briefly covered. Uh you knowuh templates and everything related totemplates is just a huge field andpeople are writing books just on thesetopics. Uh but the intention of this uhchapter is to uh give readerintroduction to template templates. Thisis by uh you know no any means a fullguide or whatsoever for templates but Ithink it serves well for introducingpeople to templates and applications ofof templates in in the code. Yeah, I Ithink that um if if you write a bookabout like apply applying C++ into afield like embedded, you you can't havelike also include the full language likeeverything about templates as a book onits own. Um andthen we get into you know using some ofthose features to build strong types anduse type safety.Uh which I think is again um one of thethings which uh where C++ shines incontrast to C and embedded when youactually can have you know some of thecalculations which otherwise would be atruntimecomp time and checks.Mhm. Uh yeah so uh we we cover uhimplicit conversions in C++ and alsoexplicit one uh in this chapter and uhthen then we move to strong types and uI used uh as an example a function froma C library uh provided by vendor uhit's part of BL stack on one of theplatforms that I worked on And uhbasically we show how we can use strongtypes to uh let's say fix some of theflows of of this function. It's uhfunction with bunch of parameters andyeah that's that's one and most of themare un 16 and most of those parametersare some kind of uh time intervals uhbut they are all treated differently. uhso they are using couple of differentmacros for uh those arguments and it'squite easy to you know swap those macrosand to use wrong one and here we showhow we can wrap this simple C functionin a u C++ to use strong types so uh ifyou actually uh swap uh those uhpreviously macros now typesuh the compiler wouldn't the compile thecompile would fail and compiler wouldalert you that uh you are using actuallywrong type uh yeah soyeah okayumthen we are in chapter 10 where the bookis then going into expressing you knowwriting expressive code with lambdas umyeah I think lambdas in general are agreat uh use case and generally makingthe it's a great feature.Yeah. Yeah. I I mean if you if you justtake uh you know take as an example anyC function uh that expects uh a somekind of call back or or similar and youare scrolling through code and you seeuh that function accepts uh somecallback and you're interested in thatfunctionality then you need either tochange file or scroll somewhere and seewhat's going on. uh right but Clambdaallows you to capture that functionalityuh in a place that's close to the callsite. So that's uh one one of theapplications which just adds to uhreadability and to expressiveness of ofthe code rightthat is true and yeah I like that you'realso then showing people that stdfunction can be used with lambdas and umthen you're using a tier 4 GPIO portsandum so the book has not always but insome chapters I've seen these nice UMLgraphswhich um I I really like makes it kindof more graphical to to people what ishappening andyesum here's another example umyeah so so that that's uh a basically alet's call it GPI interrupt manager souh on a microcontroller we have a bunchof pins and some of them you may beusing let's say as buttons so uh what wedo in that example is show you how totie interrupt that are coming from thatthose those buttons to functionalitythat you provide uh to those objectsthrough lambdas and yeah I I think it'suh something let's say different to whatfolks in uh C world are uh seeing uh andyeah use that as an example to to showhow you can use lambdasyeah I I think it's a very usefulfeature also showing like you know howto apply it to an embedded uh problemdomain. Um and and then we return to thewhole compiled time domain and use itforcomputation.Yeah. Uh well the the con expert is justone of my favorite uh features andcompile time computations in in general.Right.So uh hereuh we show uh we we gently guide readeruh to an example which shows them howthey can build a utility which allowsthem to calculate really complex signalsat compile time. And in in uh if if youscroll down there is this huge formulauh that we are using as a um table foruh temperature sensor uh which allowsyou to get uh yeah it's that one. Umif you scrollwhen I scroll up that you had uh here asthe first example a MAC address par.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think addresses aregenerally paring addresses and stringsat at time.So that that that right that allows youto enter the MAC address in humanreadable string. Yeah. And as you saiduh it allows you to parse it to uh anarray uh and it allows you to catch anan error there, right? Uh so those aretwo two functionalitiesuh that uh this piece of code is givingus. One to capture those kind of errorsand the second one is uh it convertsthis string which is human readable tojust six bytes in an array at compiletime. So nothing nothing is executed inruntime and everything happens atruntime at compile time. Right. Yeah.And and then the second example is thethe lookup table which you mentioned andthis is the example here. Umywe build a a strct signal andyeah that looks interesting.Umand here we are in the generating codethen at compile time. that is I thinkthat that's why I think it's like youknow it applies to the embedded domainbut also like if you're just generallydoing C++ and you're naturally probablyinterested and also having some embeddedknowledge the book works really well inthat domain um then we have a chapterabout writing C++ h so the hardwareproduction layer whichagain we're back into embedded rightyeahuh so uh Here we see how yeah uh most ofthe peripher not most all of theperipherals on modern microcontrollersare basically memory mapped meaning thatuh if you want to set up a GPIO uh youyou just uh write uh something in apiece of memory which in returns sets upand configures a register which ishandling that peripheral. Uh so there wesee how we do it in C and afterwards weuh go through a bit of uh template magicto see how we can strengthen that in C++uh and you know to have all thosecompile time checks. So uh they areregisters with some bit fields and whatwe want to do is to uh know exactly atcompile time which bit field are wesetting up uh which value are we writingto it and uh in in C you can uh writebasically anything at that memoryaddress nothing's going to stop you butuh with utility as this one uh we arestrengthening that and we are gettingthose compile time checks uh which arewhich allows us to write uh in in a bitfield only uh valid values right and uhall of that uh for uh you know we don'tpay any price in terms of additionalbinary size or additional computationsat runtime as everything is being doneat compile time.Yeah. And then you go into timers. Um,which is again something which you canset up at at compile time and then haveyou knowbe checked for being correct and addingup to things that make sense.Right.Andthat brings us to chapter 13 which isworking with C libraries which of courseyou know that's also every every day weinterface with C and C++. Sothisum uh yeah so so uh we show there how wecan uh wrap a a let's say C hell uh inC++uh in order to make a piece of code uhplatform independent or hardwareindependent. So for an example we canhave a uh you know uh some kind of uhwe can have let's say uh uhaccelerometer class which uh is specificto a certain uh accelerometerum and uh in order to communicate withthat accelerometer we need to use let'ssay I squared C interface uh so what wecan do for that accelerometer we canwrite a class that u depends on a IERCinterface which is u a wrapper for uhactual implementation for specifichardware platform and it basically showsyou that right uh how to decouple uhthings and how how to use C++ uh forthat but the same can be done of coursein C and this is just just more about uhthe actual approach in in thedevelopment um itselfandand also yeah of course we are usinggray there uh with an example of a filesystem. So uh LFS is a small file systemfor microcontrollers and there we showhow we can use ray um to you know if weopen a file uh we actually access tofile system and open it and in thisstructure we are closing the file. So uhres resource acquisition isinitialization. So uh we apply thatprinciple on an example of a filesystem.Yeah. And I mean that's just a classicpattern how you uh you know make makethe code betterum also in you know everyone on the teamwill then have a better time um toaccess that library. Umthen we're going to enhance super loopsequencer.Mhm.That's now something where I'm kind ofhave some question marks on my face.What is this uh just about?Yeah. So, uh a super loop is uh let'ssay the most basic uh bare metalarchitecture there is. So, uh yeah,that's a great example. You have mainwith loop and you have bunch of flagsthere and those flags are set from theinterrupts, right? And all that uh mainfunction is doing is going through thoseflags see if they are set. If they areset it will do something uh reset theflag and do that infinitely. And that'sthe most basic thing uh you can do. Uhthen we introduce a sequencer whichbasically allows you to store uh thoselet's call them task. They are basicallyfunctions but let's uh call them task.uh you can store a task in a sequencerand uh sequenceruhyou can define different priorities fortasks right something that's impossiblewith those initial approach uh withflags uhyou can also introduce priorities therebut uh all it's going to happen isyou're going to end up uh in spaghetticode right so basically sequencers issolving those uh problems for you. Itallows you to add add tasks to it and inreturns it executes those tasks for you.So uh we go there through u how toactually store a task and task can begiven as a lambda. uh one of one of theoptions is to use stood functional anduh we also have their alternative uhthere's a utility from um ETL libraryembedded template library and they haveuh equivalents to stood function whichare not using dynamic memory allocationuh which is something that's importantfor lot of embedded people so I use thatopportunity to introduce it and to showit how how it can be used right. Uh theother thing we we do there isintroducing uh stood priority Q and weprovide it with I believe uh stood uhnot stood vector but ETL vector and uhETL vector is vector from em embeddedtemplate library. It has the sameinterface as stood vector. The onlydifference is that uh once youinitialize it you give it size. It hasfixed size. So you can think about it asa fixed size vector which is alsoimportant for embedded people as they'regoing to be certain that there's nodynamic memory allocation and suchright.Yeah.Yeah. That's interesting. And especiallylike there's a domain specific libraryum which also kind of you know has typeswhich are similar to the modern C++focusand that that allow you that allows youto use them in uh stood algorithms forexample or even in this example you canuse stood priority Q and provide it withthis ETL vector uh or whatsoever. So uhit shows you how you can still use thisto library with uh let's call thisembedded template library. Uh so the ETLis kind of complementaryary to thestandard library. I I'd say that way.Mhm.Um and then we talk about patterns inthe 15th chapter.Umbuilding a temperature publisher whichis also like something which you know islikea very big problem which uh project Iwanted to say um which a lot of peopledo.Mhm. Um yeah we go there to an exampleof publisher or observer pattern and uhwe we we uh go through the both runtimeand compile time implementation of thepattern. uh the there is an example ofhow to use uh parameter pack to provideit with all those subscribers and inturn you have uh something that hasminimum uh memory footprint and it it'sjust wire let's say wire really nicelythose things for you. Um so uh yeah uhthis is something that's uh often usedin the embedded systems. You you knowyou can uh grab data from a sensor andyou need that data in different places.You want to show it on display. You wantto send it to server. You want to logthat data. Uh and what you can do isjust subscribe to publisher who'soffering that data and then do uh withthat data whatever you want. Right.Mhm. And then we move on in chapter 16to uh finite state machines.Andyeah uhuh please go ahead. Sorry forI I generally think that uh statemachines definitely have their place inin such a book. So I really like thatyou know chapter 16uh goes into um state machines andembedded. Um here we have another youknow diagram.Yeah they are really used often indifferent places for uh from controllingan elevator to uh controlling the stateof B uh controller uh and uh here we'reusing the example of B controller uhwhich can be in couple of differentstates. It can be advertising, it can beconnected, it can be in idle state. uhbut the example is really simplified andit it guides you just through a coupleof different implementation of uh an FSMusing state pattern and at the end weare introducing boost SML uh which isreally great uh library uh which allowsyou to uh define your uh state machinein really expressive way and yet againit has minimum footprint uh as It isdoing a lot of uh event dispatching atcompile time. U so it has greatperformance and minimum memory footprintand it allows you to write reallycomplex um state machines.Interesting. Umthen the 17th chapter you talk aboutlibraries and frameworks. Um and here wenow have the standard library. Again wealready talked a bit about the embeddedtemplate library. And then there is pigboot.Yeah. Uh yeah uh standard library andthe embedded library are being were useda lot in previous chapters and this thisis just a like an overview and here weintroduce uh two interesting projects.One is Google's pigweed uh which is uhkind of an entire framework for theembedded development and it uh does alot of heavy lifting for you. Uh so it'squite an interesting thing that uhpeople can go through this simple basicexample and see uh what it offers and uhhere uh we are using RPC a remoteprocedure call uh feature that it offersand it shows you how you can uh triggercertain actions on your target uh from auh Python console and uh this is quiteuseful uh for two things in the contextof the embedded system. Uh one is uhwhile you're doing development, youoccasionally want to test some uhfunctionality on target and uh you knowif you are working with really complexembedded systems uh you want to be ableto trigger that behavior immediatelywithout waiting to go through certainscenarios or whatsoever. So uh the RPCallows you that. So you can uh triggercertain function call or functionalityon your target uh from a console andthat's something that's also usefulduring manufacturing. So if you'remanufacturing a device, you want to beable to test it uh and there are entirescenarios for testing uh devices duringthe manufacturing process and you need away to trigger certain behaviors. Sothis is something that's uh quiteinteresting in that regard. And theother uh yeahI think like just then like the nextchapter already moves into this like umlike cross platform development and whenyou manufacture things that you know youneed to be able to um not only like testyour code on the embedded platform butalso have the ability to test therebecause some bugs will only show there.Umof course. Yeah. Uhright. As as you said uh the the entirebook is stressing out the importance ofuh hardware independent code uh whichallows you to test that code to test thebusiness logic uh to have the unit testsand uh the this chapter just wraps up uhthat uh story about the softwaredevelopment in in general right with theuh accent on C++ and the embeddedsystemsYeah. And yeah, I think that's that'skind ofthe book closes out on testability andhere the summary. Um,okay. So,let's get started with the interview.And that has been the book overview. Um,it's with 17 chapters. is reallycovering a lot of ground about C++ butalso aboutum embeddedandthen let's see um to the audience justif you have questions then[Music]post them to the chat and I of coursehave some questions preparedSogenerally you know we are in theembedded space. So maybe let's startwith that. Um what embedded hardwarehave you used to test the code and runthe code on uh for thebook? Uh so the the uh code is using theuh STM32F71uh target. uh but uh you don't needactual developer uh development kit inorder to be able to run the code as uhyou can download docker container whichhas the entire tool chain uh preparedfor you and it also has a renodesimulator which allows you to runcompiled code uh in the simulator rightso uh you you can also if if you wantyou can uh run the code you flush youruh target with the firmware. But ingeneral uh if uh you are reading thebook you you don't need uh thedevelopment kit development board at allandumsoI think it's fairly clear for which thisaudience the book is. Umbut like let's take for a minute withC++. Uh what standards have you used ormostly used in the book?Um the the book covers uh features uhfrom standards up up to C++ 23.23. Um but a lot of developers are stillon 17 and now we're moving on to newfeatures. So the book has that covered.Umthat was also my impression. Umlet's uh go into some of the audiencequestions.SoBlizzio asks why don't you use SDLcontainers with specialized allocators?Yeah, that's that's also an option,right? Uh I haven't tried to write aspecialized allocator. Uh to be honest,I think that's quite challenging to getit right uh to guarantee uh theexecution time which is something that'salso important in regards of the realtime embedded systems. Uh you want to besure that the allocation would alwaystake certain amount of time, right?uh still uh yeah that's that's apossibility but uh ETL embedded templatelibrary uh is an alternativeuh for for the containers.Yeah and I I think one thing one alwayshas to see is that the the space in abook is limited. So going into suchcorners as how to specialize uhallocators for embedded um might be thena bit too much. Um which actually bringsmeto question like you know we see a lotof chapters in the book but like whattopics didn't make it?Oh yeah. UhI'd say a lot. Uhso uh things such as bitset is not inthe book. Uh some of the examples Iinitially had in mind that uh could havebeen more visually appealing to peopleare not there. So uh one of the ideas Ihad is seven segment uh display and ituh didn't end in the book. And yeah,there's there's quite a few things thatthat are not there. So, uh by no anymeans this is this is not a completeguide uh for the C++ and embeddedsystems. It is uh let's call it missinguh a lot of things. I wish they werethere, but uh I I was limited by timeand if you'd put everything in a book,it would be uh really really really bigbook, right?Indeed. Uh do you have plans like for afollow-up book?Uh I'm not sure. Let's see uh how thisgoes. Uh let's see uh how the receptionfrom the people is. Uh the book waspublished on 2nd of July. So that waslike 15 days ago. So in uh followingmonths I expect to receive uh morefeedback uh from people who read thebook and I guess that everything willdepend on that if the book is acceptedwell then yeah why not?Mhm. Yeah that's maybe something we weshould mention that the book is is kindof new andsoio has a second question. How can yoube sure that an SD function doesn'tallocate memory while storing lambdas?Uh, one of the things to do is tooverride new and delete operators andjust to monitor them and see if uhthey're being called by anything. Andthat's just uh one of the ways to uhmake sure that uh no one is trying to doany memory allocation. But if you wantto be 100% certain then uh just avoid itright.Yeah I think that especially like youbring up the ETL in this context thatyou know they offer the type whichdoesn't allocate and on the other handum I think with lambdas you're on thesafe side when you're using function umbut I I've had also you know somepitfalls with function and them etc. Um,sothere's another question. Do you plan tocreate an online course with the topicsfrom the book?Uh, no not not really. I don't I don'thave any plans to be honest uh at themoment.Okay. Umthenhow does this book help you to writebetter C++ code?Huh well uh the intention of the book isto introduce C++ to people who aremainly using C in uh their daily workand uh I did uh the best of my abilityto write a good and uh well structuredC++ code. Uh maybe I failed at someparts and if you have any you know uhcriticism on on some portions of it,please let me know.UmI think that the the book probablyreflects your own style and what you doon your on your company, how you um doyour there. So uh what did you learnabout C++ while writing the book?Um uh this is a tough one. Um I I had toexplore some some uh portions of uhof of what I was already applying and uhI was taking some uh things for grantedthat uh I discovered later on that areperhaps a bit different. And uh one ofthem is mostly related to um the uh thestandard library. So uh the one that'sbeing used is um based on uh nanostardlibrary and uh there are just a fewdifferent ways to compile that library uwith or without exceptions and in turnyou end up with uh quite a bigdifference in terms of the memoryconsumptions and it turns out that theexceptions exceptions in this uhimplementationare quite expensive. Uh I haven't uhspent more time uh digging out uh youknow about exceptions and seeing ifthere's any better implementation. Sothat's one of the things that I'm quiteinterested in and uh yeah once I havesome more time that's something that I'dlike to explore further. uh so uh by thetime of writing book I wasn't evenconsidering using exceptions and in oneof the chapters I wrote about them andonly then I saw how uh big portion of uhof the flesh they actually take uhperhaps it's implementation specificperhaps the library itself can becompiled a bit differently to still haveexceptions andto reduce that size. So, uh that'sthat's one of the things that surprisedme a bit.Yeah. So, I think that with embeddedaudience exceptions are not too popular.Oh yeah, that's quitethe question in in the recent yearsalways has become like what what kind ofembedded are you working on and systemshave grown and there's definitely somespace for where exceptions could makesense. Umoutside of that you probably have thiscode then shared ac across your platformand then maybe that's not making senseanymore. Umbut so one one topic which I saw whichhas been very important in the lastdecade in C++ generally is like theexploration of multi-threaded code and Iwonder just you know how is that beingseen in the embedded worldum uh so uh the most of the projectsthat I worked on are still utilizingfree arts uh which has the threads fortasks as they called and in certainapplications it's actually used quite alot uh I haven't I didn't have a chanceto use uh C++ in uh those kinds ofenvironment uh in in last year or so uhI've been mostly working with C on onprojects for our clients uh but yeah uhmulti-threaded code is used quite a lotespecially on a big and and complex umsystems.Okay. Um so just to the audience if youhave any more questions um now it's kindof the time to add them to the chat. Umthere isprobably like when when we talk aboutembedded and the the book covers a bitof safety. Umwe should talk about rust you know is doyou see rust in the embedded space isthat something which is coming up.Uh I I see a lot of people talking aboutit and I see a certain companies arestarted adopting it. Uhso yeah I I I'm seeing uh Rust gettingits way into the uh into the embedded uhlast year and a half or so I was prettymuch occupied with writing uh the bookso I didn't really had chance to exploreRust more but uh I I got the basicpremises of it uh the borrow checker anduh what it offers in terms of uh typeand memory safety uh and uh those thingsare always welcomed in in the embeddedsystems especially those that are safetycritical uh so uh yeah I definitely seeRust having its place in the embeddedall right and there's also a questionand commentin which I see on LinkedIn but itdoesn't show up here in the local studioso let me quickly copy that into abannerand then I can show it here. So whilewhile we at the topic of rust um sothese days are you know they areexploring ways of using rust lang in ourcode for C++ um what are your thoughtsabout mixing rust lang with C++ fordedicated modules and written a must inrust for exampleum uh to be honest I don't have ahands-on experience uh on on rust or onmixing these two but if rust is solvinga problem for you and you want to usethat as a module in C++ or vice versa. Idon't see any any reasons against that.Uh both trust and C++ are tools in inour world. So uh using the right toolfor the right problem is uh mostcertainly welcomed. Right? So if you seethat a good fit then go for it.Yeah, I think uh the interoperability ofRust and C++ is something which somepeople explore currently and for exampleCSV++ we have one talk about that I knowthat KB is exploring it in the contextof doing Rust with cute and so umthere's definitely areas where you findinformation about that um but then againit's like when when when when you doembed with C++ and your everyday work islike C and and C++ then um it's hard tofind like actually you know someone toto pay for your time to go into Rust andto figure out what the best way is toconnect that um so I hope that we thatwe get a better way of you know havingthe standardized and umbecome part of our world umAndthat brings us pretty much to the end.Uh I think um I have no more questions.It's a very interesting book. Thank youfor taking your time and taking the timeto write this book and sharing your ownknowledge with us. Uh which is veryinteresting in in this book definitely.And umI see that at least one person hasbought the book already. Sothank you Floren andthank you very muchwith that Amar final words.Umyeah I I might be biased as I you knowlove C++.Uh I I really that that's something thatI really enjoy. So this is me beingcompletely biased, right? Uh and yeah, Ijust think it's great for the embeddedsystems and if you would like toactually see what it can do for you, uhthen read read the book, right? Uh butthis is a completely biased opinion ofmine.Yeah, I mean it's I think we're on thesame page there. I'm I'm also a bitbiased towards C++ and I think theaudience we reach is too.Umbut generally interesting topic todayand lots of interest. Saw a lot ofpeople in the in the chat and also inthe stream on LinkedIn. Um and if youmade it so far a recording will be outon Saturday. Um anyways, thank you foryour time and I'm going toThank you. Yes. Thank you so much.You're welcome. Also, last but notleast, thank you to Peek for providingthe book and, you know, making thispossible.\""

Um and as you know thesubtitle shows there there's also uhsome C code in here. Um so we have thefirst chapter starting with debunkingsome common myths about C++.

So we directly divenow into embedded systems and that ismore domain. So what is uh kind of yourthoughts on the second chapter?Um yeah so uhhere we discuss uh mainly uh challengesin safety critical and uh real-timesystems with hard requirements and twothings that I often criticized u interms of C++ is that uh you can't usestandard library without dynamic memoryallocation uh which is not true rightyou you need to be aware of uhcontainers that are using it and thosethat are not.\"),\n",

Umbut like let's take for a minute withC++. Uh what standards have you used ormostly used in the book?Um the the book covers uh features uhfrom standards up up to C++ 23.23. Um but a lot of developers are stillon 17 and now we're moving on to newfeatures. So the book has that covered.Umthat was also my impression. Umlet's uh go into some of the audiencequestions.SoBlizzio asks why don't you use SDLcontainers with specialized allocators?Yeah, that's that's also an option,right? Uh I haven't tried to write aspecialized allocator. Uh to be honest,I think that's quite challenging to getit right uh to guarantee uh\"),\n",

Uh you want to besure that the allocation would alwaystake certain amount of time, right?uh still uh yeah that's that's apossibility but uh ETL embedded templatelibrary uh is an alternativeuh for for the containers.Yeah and I I think one thing one alwayshas to see is that the the space in abook is limited. So going into suchcorners as how to specialize uhallocators for embedded um might be thena bit too much. Um which actually bringsmeto question like you know we see a lotof chapters in the book but like whattopics didn't make it?Oh yeah. UhI'd say a lot. Uhso uh things such as bitset is not inthe book.

How can yoube sure that an SD function doesn'tallocate memory while storing lambdas?Uh, one of the things to do is tooverride new and delete operators andjust to monitor them and see if uhthey're being called by anything. Andthat's just uh one of the ways to uhmake sure that uh no one is trying to doany memory allocation. But if you wantto be 100% certain then uh just avoid itright.Yeah I think that especially like youbring up the ETL in this context thatyou know they offer the type whichdoesn't allocate and on the other handum I think with lambdas you're on thesafe side when you're using\"),\n",

Do you plan tocreate an online course with the topicsfrom the book?Uh, no not not really. I don't I don'thave any plans to be honest uh at themoment.Okay. Umthenhow does this book help you to writebetter C++ code?Huh well uh the intention of the book isto introduce C++ to people who aremainly using C in uh their daily workand uh I did uh the best of my abilityto write a good and uh well structuredC++ code.

Andthat's just uh one of the ways to uhmake sure that uh no one is trying to\\n\\nfunction whichare not using dynamic memory allocationuh which is something that's importantfor lot of embedded people so I use thatopportunity to introduce it and to showit how how it can be used right. Uh theother thing we we do there isintroducing uh stood priority Q and weprovide it with I believe uh stood uhnot stood vector but ETL vector and uhETL vector is vector from em embeddedtemplate library. It has the sameinterface as stood vector. The onlydifference is that uh once youinitialize it you give it size. It hasfixed size. So you can think about it asa fixed size vector which is alsoimportant for embedded people as they'regoing to be certain that there's nodynamic memory allocation and suchright.>> Yeah.Yeah.
